**Introduction to Tic Tac Toe Game**

Welcome to the world of Tic Tac Toe, a timeless and classic board game that has captivated minds and brought joy to players of all ages for generations. With a history that traces back to ancient civilizations, Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, has evolved into a beloved pastime and a staple in the realm of strategy games.

The concept of Tic Tac Toe is elegantly simple, yet its gameplay offers an engaging challenge that requires strategic thinking and foresight. Played on a 3x3 grid, the game pits two opponents against each other, each symbolized by either an "X" or an "O."
